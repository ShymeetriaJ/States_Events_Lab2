# Lab Title: 
Lab 2: Props and State


# Date Completed: 
December 7, 2025

# Lab Description: 
 In this lab, I created an interactive character counter application that demonstrates state management and event handling in React. The application allows users to input text and see real-time statistics about their input, including character count, word count, and reading time. This lab focuses on state management, event handling, and component interaction using React hooks.
 
# My reflection:

# How did you handle state updates when the text changed?

# What considerations did you make when calculating reading time?

# How did you ensure the UI remained responsive during rapid text input?

# What challenges did you face when implementing the statistics calculations?
